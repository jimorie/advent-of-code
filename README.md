# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

All solutions are written for Python 3.8+ and use only standard library utilities.

All solution files can be executed without arguments on the command line. The script assumes there is a matching input file under an `input` directory relative to the script. E.g. `./day01a.py` will try to read `./input/day01`.

    $ python3 day01a.py
    719796

The `runall.py` script can be used to execute all solution files in the repo:

    $ python3 runall.py
    day01a.py: 888331
        (0.005 s)
    day01b.py: 130933530
        (0.102 s)
    day02a.py: 378
        (0.004 s)
    day02b.py: 280
        (0.006 s)
    day03a.py: 195
        (0.001 s)
    ...
