# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

All solutions are written in Python 3.8 and use only standard library utilities.

All solutions read the puzzle input from stdin and write the answer to stdout. E.g.:

    $ python day1a.py < input-file
    719796

The `runall.py` script can be used to excecute all solutions against the repo input files:

    $ python runall.py
    day1a.py: 888331
        (0.005 s)
    day1b.py: 130933530
        (0.102 s)
    day2a.py: 378
        (0.004 s)
    day2b.py: 280
        (0.006 s)
    day3a.py: 195
        (0.001 s)
    ...
