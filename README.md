# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

All solutions are written in Python 3.8 and use only standard library utilities.

All solutions read the puzzle input from stdin and write the answer to stdout. E.g.:

    $ python day1a.py < input-file
    719796
